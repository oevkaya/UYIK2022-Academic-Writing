# A level 1 title

## A level 2 title: R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

### A level 3 title

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="a figure-caption"}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

### A small table

```{r}
nselect <- 5
```


A table with only `r nselect` of the `r nrow(cars)` observations

```{r}

pander(cars[1:nselect,],
       caption = "A table caption")

```


# A final title

## Now really the final title

Just some text
